# AOC-2021
Advent of Code 2021

So I'm taking this opportunity to teach myself nim. I've worked with it 
a bit before and like what it brings to the table, but never really for
an extended period of time or for anything beyond a toy program. So because
of this, the code I may write may look a little dumb at times, but I'll
try to write things to be nice and maintainable.
